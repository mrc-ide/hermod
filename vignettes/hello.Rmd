# Before starting

Ensure you have connected to the DIDE network by using zscalar; see [instructions from ICT](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/remote-access/unified-access/), or by being on a desktop PC or virtual machine within the building that is plugged in by ethernet (this is less common now).

Install R and RStudio, if you have not already.

Install the packages by running

```r
install.packages(
  c("hipercow", "hipercow.windows"),
  repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Map a network drive (instructions to be copied over)

Start by creating an [Rstudio project](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) in your home directory, or in another network drive from above.  Once you have done this, you should be able to run


```r
getwd()
#> [1] "/home/rich/net/home/cluster/hipercow-vignette/hv-20231222-122da58dcb29a"
```

and recognise that this is a network path (see `vignette("details")` for more information if you are unclear on this).

# Hello world

This is the state of my workstation:


```r
sessionInfo()
#> R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)

```

you can see that I run Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, which might be different to you, but it's *certainly* different to the cluster. Our aim is to run this small piece of code on the cluster.

First, load the package


```r
library(hipercow)
```

Then create a hipercow root:


```r
hipercow_init(".", driver = "windows")
#> ✔ Initialised hipercow at '.'
#> ✔ Configured hipercow to use 'windows'
```

Enqueue a task; here the expression `sessionInfo()`


```r
id <- task_create_expr(sessionInfo())
#> ✔ Submitted task '94333d3ae6b90d8147c2ea0c71cacfb1' using 'windows'
```

Then, wait for the task to return, followed by fetching its result:


```r
task_wait(id)
#> [1] TRUE
task_result(id)
#> R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21 ucrt)
#> Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
#> Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)
#>
#> Matrix products: default
#>
#>
#> locale:
#> [1] LC_COLLATE=English_United Kingdom.utf8
#> [2] LC_CTYPE=English_United Kingdom.utf8
#> [3] LC_MONETARY=English_United Kingdom.utf8
#> [4] LC_NUMERIC=C
#> [5] LC_TIME=English_United Kingdom.utf8
#>
#> time zone: Europe/London
#> tzcode source: internal
#>
#> attached base packages:
#> [1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base
#>
#> loaded via a namespace (and not attached):
#> [1] compiler_4.3.0  cli_3.6.2       rprojroot_2.0.4 withr_2.5.2
#> [5] hipercow_0.1.0  rlang_1.1.2
```

You can see that the `sessionInfo` result here is different to the above, as it ran on another machine.
