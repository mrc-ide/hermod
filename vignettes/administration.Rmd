Are you reading the right manual?  If you are not sure, you are probably not!

# Rebuilding the bootstrap library

Ensure that the packages have built and are on the r-universe; this might take a little while (it rebuilds once an hour). Check on the [builds page](https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev/builds) to see if it has updated.

Install your own copy of hipercow as usual (you'll need `hipercow.windows` and `conan2` but these will be installed on use if you don't have them already).

```r
install.packages(
  "hipercow",
  repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Set your working directory to anywhere on a network share (home drives are fine for this).

Trigger building the bootstrap with:

```r
library(hipercow)
hipercow_init(".")
hipercow_configure("windows", r_version = "4.2.3")
hipercow.windows:::bootstrap_update()

hipercow_configure("windows", r_version = "4.3.0")
hipercow.windows:::bootstrap_update()
```

# Testing a copy of hipercow on the cluster

If you want to test a copy of hipercow on the cluster, you need to install a specific version of it somewhere it will be picked up.  The simplest way of doing this is to install everything into a new bootstrap environment.

Create a new development bootstrap library by running (as above, from a network location):

```r
hipercow::hipercow_init(".")
hipercow::hipercow_configure("windows", r_version = "4.3.0")
hipercow.windows:::bootstrap_update(development = "mrc-4827")
```

Now you can use your new version, after setting the option `hipercow.development = TRUE`:

```
library(hipercow)
hipercow_init(".", "windows")
options(hipercow.development = TRUE)
id <- task_create_expr(sessionInfo())
task_status(id)
task_log_show(id)
task_status(id)
task_result(id)
```

It is assumed that you have the development version installed locally yourself, which is likely the case.

# Recreating the vignettes

These need to be run in a networks share so set an environment variable like

```
HIPERCOW_VIGNETTE_ROOT=/path/to/share
```

in your `.Renviron` inidicating where we should work.  We'll make lots of directories here.  I'm still working on a nice way of unlocking the password automatically for non-windows use though.

Each vignette can be built by running (ideally in a fresh session with the working directory as the package root)

```
options(hipercow.development = TRUE)
knitr::knit("vignettes_src/hello.Rmd", "vignettes/hello.Rmd")
knitr::knit("vignettes_src/hipercow.Rmd", "vignettes/hipercow.Rmd")
knitr::knit("vignettes_src/packages.Rmd", "vignettes/packages.Rmd")
knitr::knit("vignettes_src/troubleshooting.Rmd", "vignettes/troubleshooting.Rmd")
```

which generates a dummy Rmd file within vignettes/ for each version of the real vignette in `vignettes_src/`

On the command line, `make vignettes` will run through all vignettes, but this seems to only work on some versions of make.
