# Rebuilding the bootstrap library

Ensure that the packages have built and are on the r-universe; this might take a little while (it rebuilds once an hour). Check on the [builds page](https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev/builds) to see if it has updated.

Install your own copy of hipercow as usual (you'll need `hipercow.windows` and `conan2` but these will be installed on use if you don't have them already).

```r
install.packages(
  "hipercow",
  repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Set your working directory to anywhere on a network share (home drives are fine for this).

Trigger building the bootstrap with:

```r
hipercow.windows:::bootstrap_update_all()
```

This will update all versions on the cluster that are at most one minor version older than the most recent.  It does have the side effect of changing the windows configuration for wherever you run the command to the most recent supported R version.

# Testing a copy of hipercow on the cluster

If you want to test a copy of hipercow on the cluster, you need to install a specific version of it somewhere it will be picked up.  The simplest way of doing this is to install everything into a new bootstrap environment.

Create a new development bootstrap library by running (as above, from a network location):

```r
hipercow::hipercow_init(".")
hipercow::hipercow_configure("windows", r_version = "4.3.0")
hipercow.windows:::bootstrap_update(development = "mrc-4827")
```

Now you can use your new version, after setting the option `hipercow.development = TRUE`:

```
library(hipercow)
hipercow_init(".", "windows", r_version = "4.3.0") # needs to match above
options(hipercow.development = TRUE)
id <- task_create_expr(sessionInfo())
task_status(id)
task_log_show(id)
task_status(id)
task_result(id)
```

It is assumed that you have the development version installed locally yourself, which is likely the case.

# Recreating the vignettes

These need to be run in a network share so set an environment variable like

```
HIPERCOW_VIGNETTE_ROOT=/path/to/share
```

in your `.Renviron` indicating where we should work.  We'll make lots of directories here.

Each vignette can be built by running (ideally in a fresh session with the working directory as the package root)

```r
knitr::knit("vignettes_src/windows.Rmd", "vignettes/windows.Rmd")
knitr::knit("vignettes_src/packages.Rmd", "vignettes/packages.Rmd")
```

which generates a new `windows.Rmd` file within `vignettes/` that contains no runnable code and so can be safely run on CI.

You may want to run `options(hipercow.development = TRUE)` to build using the development versions (see above).

The remaining vignettes use the example driver so they can be run independent of any actual cluster.

On the command line, `make vignettes` will run through all vignettes, but this seems to only work on some versions of make.
