\description{
Create a hipercow root.  This marks the directory where your task
information will be saved, along with a local copy of your R
packages (a "library" for the cluster).  Immediately after running
this the first time, you probably want to run
\code{\link[=hipercow_configure]{hipercow_configure()}} in order to control how we set up
your projects network paths and R version.
